# Open Video Calls
OVC is a small personal project written for learning and demonstration purposes

## Key areas explored in this project
- Client-server architecture communicating through UDP sockets
- RTP for ordering and jitter buffering UDP packets
- OpenCV for camera and window I/O
- NumPy for mathematical image operations
- Multi-threaded network logic to avoid blocking UI

### Running locally

- Install Cargo to run or build the server
- Install Python to run the client(s)

*A small dev script is included at dev_test.py, this will launch an instance of the server and a few instances of the client*
